# Transcription factor binding site atlas: A case study in reproducible big data science

- **Followings are the supplementary information that these directories contains workflows and scripts used to generate DNase footprint, TF binding motif, and database.**

   - Steps 1, 2, 3 generating datasets D1, D2, D3 [generate_footprints](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_footprints) - This generate_footprints provide an instruction for how to run the DNAse footprinting workflow and include a demo snapshot.

   - Step 4 generating D5 [generate_motif](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_motif) - This generate_motif directory is a guideline if one needs to create transcription factor motifs. The motif file is used for annotating  the footprints.

   - Step 5 generating D6 [generate_db](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_db) - The generate_db directory shows a step-by-step procedure along with the processing code to intersect hint or wellington] footprints output with the FIMO database and put the results in a database.
- [getting_started](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/getting_started) - This getting_started shows how to access the footprint databases and provides a case example for query.
