**Following steps contain links to workflows and scripts that were used to generate DNase footprints, TF binding motifs, and databases. Step numbers and dataset numbers follow the conventions used in the paper.**

   - Please follow these instructions to reproduce Steps 1-3 that generate datasets D1-3
     - [generate_footprints](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_footprints) - Instructions on running the DNAse footprinting workflow on Globus Genomics.

   - Documentation for generating D5 (transcription factor motif file that is used for annotating the footprints)
     - [generate_motif](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_motif) 

   - Documentation for Step 5 generating D6. These instructions show a step-by-step procedure, along with the code to intersect hint or wellington footprints output with the FIMO database and save the output in a local directory. 
     - [generate_db](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/generate_db)
     
- [getting_started](https://github.com/globusgenomics/genomics-footprint/tree/master/getting_started) - This is a R notebook that  shows how to access and query the footprint database.
